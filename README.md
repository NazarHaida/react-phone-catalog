Technologies Used

React: For building the user interface with a component-based architecture.

Redux: For managing global state, including favorite products.

React Router: For handling navigation and routing.

SCSS Modules: For styling and maintaining a modular approach to CSS.

TypeScript: For ensuring type safety and improving code maintainability.

JSON Data Handling: For fetching product data from local JSON files.

Development Methodologies

1. Component-Based Architecture

The project is built using React, where each UI element is represented as a separate component, promoting code reusability and ease of maintenance.

2. State Management

Redux is used for managing global state, making it easier to handle data (e.g., favorite products).

3. Routing

React Router is used for internal navigation, allowing users to move between categories and product pages without a full-page reload.

4. Responsiveness and UX

SCSS modules are used for component styling.

Touch event support is implemented for a better mobile experience.

5. Lazy Loading and Performance Optimization

Lazy loading improves performance and reduces network load.

6. API Handling

Data is fetched from JSON files (e.g., phones.json, tablets.json, accessories.json), making updates and expansions easier.
